NVIM:
- Requires neovim 0.5.1
- Nvim config based on https://medium.com/swlh/neovim-lsp-dap-and-fuzzy-finder-60337ef08060
    - It's probably nowhere near the same anymore
- Need a terminal with true colours (or change the theme) Mac OS default terminal doesn't support true colours :(
- In addition nvim-lsputils requires bat (like cat but able to better colouring / formatting)
- First run would produce a bunch of errors as no plugins are installed, use the :PackerSync command
